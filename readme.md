# ZMK firmware for the TOTEM keyboard

Thanks to [bsag's article](https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/totem-keyboard/) on such a niche topic. This fork was born from her repo.

This is a ZMK firmware for the [TOTEM keyboard](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM) with a hungarian QWERTZ layout, combined with [urob's timeless home row mods](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config). 

Keys like öüóőúű are defined in combos.
